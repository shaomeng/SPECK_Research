These results are from DWT->IDWT transforms using QccPack.

The wavelet kernel choice is always CDF9/7.

The two folders, filter_bank and lifting, represent using filter banks or 
lifting schemes to perform the wavelet transforms.

The file aggre_results in each folder has the final results from 6 faces.
